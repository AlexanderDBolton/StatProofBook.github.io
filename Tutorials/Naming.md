title: Naming Conventions
---


When adding a proof to "The Book of Statistical Proofs", please try to adhere to the following naming conventions:

1. The *title of a proof* typically combines the [name of the theorem](/Tutorials/Metadata.md) with the [topic it belongs to](/Tutorials/Metadata.md).
   Example: "Linear transformation theorem \[name of the theorem\] for the multivariate normal distribution \[topic it belongs to\]".

2. The *shortcut of a proof* typically connects an abbreviation for the topic with an abbreviation of the theorem.
   Example: `mvn` \[for "multivariate normal distribution"\] + `ltt` \[for "linear transformation theorem\] = `mvn-ltt`.
