title: Naming Conventions
---


When adding a proof to "The Book of Statistical Proofs", please try to adhere to the following rules:

1. The *title of a proof* typically combines the [name of the theorem](/Tutorials/Metadata.html#Taxonomy) with the [topic it belongs to](/Tutorials/Metadata.html#Taxonomy).
 
   Example: "Linear transformation theorem \[theorem\] for the multivariate normal distribution \[topic\]".

2. The *shortcut of a proof* typically connects abbreviations of the topic and of the theorem.
 
   Example: `mvn` \[for "multivariate normal distribution"\] + `ltt` \[for "linear transformation theorem\] = `mvn-ltt`.
