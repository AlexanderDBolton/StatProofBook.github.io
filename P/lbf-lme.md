**Theorem:** Let $m_1$ and $m_2$ be two statistical models with [log model evidences](/D/lme) $\mathrm{LME}(m_1)$ and $\mathrm{LME}(m_2)$. Then, the [log Bayes factor](/D/lbf) in favor of model $m_1$ and against model $m_2$ is the difference of the log model evidences:

$$ \label{eq:LBF-LME}
\mathrm{LBF}_{1,2} = \mathrm{LME}(m_1) - \mathrm{LME}(m_2) \; .
$$


**Proof:** The [log Bayes factor](/D/lbf) (LBF) is defined as the logarithm of the [Bayes factor](/D/bf) (BF) which is defined as the posterior odds ratio when both models are equally likely apriori:

$$ \label{eq:LBF-s1}
\begin{split}
\mathrm{LBF}_{1,2} &= \log \mathrm{BF}_{1,2} \\
&= \log \frac{p(m_1|y)}{p(m_2|y)} \; .
\end{split}
$$

Plugging in the posterior odds ratio according to [Bayes' rule](/P/bayes-rule), we have

$$ \label{eq:LBF-s2}
\mathrm{LBF}_{1,2} = \log \left[ \frac{p(y|m_1)}{p(y|m_2)} \cdot \frac{p(m_1)}{p(m_2)} \right] \; .
$$

When both models are equally likely apriori, the prior odds ratio is one, such that

$$ \label{eq:LBF-s3}
\mathrm{LBF}_{1,2} = \log \frac{p(y|m_1)}{p(y|m_2)} \; .
$$

Resolving the logarithm and applying the definition of the [log model evidence](/D/lme), we finally have:

$$ \label{eq:LBF-s4}
\begin{split}
\mathrm{LBF}_{1,2} &= \log p(y|m_1) - \log p(y|m_2) \\
&= \mathrm{LME}(m_1) - \mathrm{LME}(m_2) \; .
\end{split}
$$
