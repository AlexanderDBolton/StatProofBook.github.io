Everyone can contribute to **The Book of Statistical Proofs**! Depending on your mathematical knowledge, your computer science skills and the time you are willing to invest, there are five different levels of contributing to the project where contribution intensity increases from first to last level.


## Level 1: suggest a theorem to be proven

**Required: a web browser and access to Google Docs (but no Google account)**

1. Go to the [online document for suggesting a theorem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J2t0MXsPYckhoN8-Out8qJv7espX-xAQurYcPUXJMV8/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Enter the name of the theorem and, if possible, a URL for more information.


## Level 2: provide source for existing proof

**Required: a web browser and access to Google Sheets (but no Google account)**

1. Go to the [online sheet for providing sources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIqVvAgcQL72HCPZ9KDaCZXZRVxBhkrEiLX1Dr7p4Kg/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Enter one proof source per row, following the instructions in the sheet.


## Level 3: send a LaTeX file to the archive

**Required: LaTeX processing software and an e-mail address**

1. Pick a theorem of your choice and write (or retrieve) a LaTeX document proving this theorem.
2. Send this file to [StatProofBook@gmail.com](mailto:StatProofBook@gmail.com) and/or [joram.soch@bccn-berlin.de](mailto:joram.soch@bccn-berlin.de).


## Level 4: send a Markdown file to the archive

**Required: LaTeX/Markdown processing software and an e-mail address**

1. Pick a theorem of your choice and write a LaTeX document proving this theorem.
2. Download the [Markdown template for The Book of Statistical Proofs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StatProofBook/StatProofBook.github.io/master/Proofs/-temp-.md)
3. Paste your LaTeX proof into the lower half of that document (starting from line 35).
4. Fill in the proof metadata in the upper half of that document (up until line 33).
5. Send this file to [StatProofBook@gmail.com](mailto:StatProofBook@gmail.com) and/or [joram.soch@bccn-berlin.de](mailto:joram.soch@bccn-berlin.de).


## Level 5: add a proof to the archive yourself

**Required: GitHub account and LaTeX/Markdown processing software**

To do so, fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/StatProofBook/StatProofBook.github.io), add a proof and launch a pull request. More information will come soon...
