**Definition:** Let $X_{1}, ..., X_{k}$ be [independent](/D/ind) [random variables](/D/rvar) where each of them is following a [standard normal distribution](/D/snorm):

$$ \label{eq:snorm}
X_{i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1) \; .
$$.

Then, the sum of their squares follows a chi-square distribution with $k$ degrees of freedom:

$$\label{eq:chi2}
Y = \sum_{i=1}^{k} X_{i}^{2} \sim \chi^{2}(k) \quad \text{where} \quad k > 0 \; .
$$

A [random variables](/D/rvar) $Y$ is said said to follow a chi-square distribution with $k$ number of degress of freedom, if and only if its [probability density function](/D/pdf) is given by

$$ \label{eq:chi2-pdf}
\chi^{2}(x; k) = \frac{1}{2^{k/2}\Gamma (k/2)} \, x^{k/2-1} \, e^{-x/2}
$$

where $k > 0$ and the density is zero if $x \leq 0$.
