**Definition:** Let $X$ be a [continuous](/D/rvar-disc) [random variable](/D/rvar) with some [probability distribution](/D/dist) $P$ characterized by [probability density function](/D/pdf) $f_X(x)$. Then,

* $P$ is called a unimodal probability distribution, if $f_X(x)$ has exactly one maximum;

* $P$ is called a bimodal probability distribution, if $f_X(x)$ has exactly two maxima;

* $P$ is called a trimodal probability distribution, if $f_X(x)$ has exactly three maxima;

* $P$ is called a multimodal probability distribution, if $f_X(x)$ has more than one maximum.

Note that this definition of multimodality differs from the [strict definition of the mode](/D/mode) in which only the global maximum of $f_X(x)$ [would be considered the single mode](/D/mode).
