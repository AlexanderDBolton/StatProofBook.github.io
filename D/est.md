**Definition:** Let $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ be [measured data](/D/data), governed by a [probability distribution](/D/dist) described by some [statistical parameter](/D/para) $\theta \in \Theta$. Then, a function $\hat{\theta}: \mathcal{Y} \rightarrow \Theta$ exemplifying a rule for calculating an estimate of $\theta$ from $y$ is called an "estimator". Estimation theory distinguishes:

* the quantify of interest $\theta$ is called the "estimand";

* the rule $\hat{\theta}$ for estimating it is called "estimator";

* the result of estimation $\hat{\theta}(y)$ is called "estimate".
