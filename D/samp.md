**Definition:** Let $X$ be a [random variable](/D/rvar) or a set of [random variables](/D/rvar). Then, a sample, also "statistical sample", is a set of realizations of this random variable, obtained via [observation and measurement](/D/data) within [random experiments](/D/rexp):

$$ \label{eq:samp}
x = \left\lbrace x_1, \ldots, x_n \right\rbrace \; .
$$

The number of elements in a sample is called "[sample size](/D/samp-size)".
