**Definition:** Let $X_{1}, ..., X_{k}$ be [independent random variables](/D/rvar), where each of them is following standard normal distribution  ($X_{i} \sim \mathcal N(0,1)$). Then, the sum of their squares,
$Y\ =\sum _{i=1}^{k}X_{i}^{2},$ follows  chi-square distribution with $k$ degrees of freedom 
$$\label{eq:chi-2} Y\ \sim \ \chi ^{2}(k)\ ; , $$
where $k > 0$.

**Definition:** Let $Y$ be a random continous variable. Then, $Y$ is said to follow a chi-square distribution with $k$ number of degress of freedom

$$\label{eq:chi-2} Y\ \sim \ \chi ^{2}(k)\ ; ,$$

if and only if its probability density function is given by

$$ \label{eq:chi-2-pdf} \chi ^{2}(x; k) = {\frac {1}{2^{k/2}\Gamma (k/2)}}\;x^{k/2-1}e^{-x/2}\; $$

where $k > 0$ and the density is zero if $x \leq 0$.
