If you have [submitted a proof via GitHub](/contribute/) and entered your username [into the metadata](/Tutorials/Metadata.md), this proof's page will automatically link to your GitHub profile. Here's [an example](/Proofs/mvn-ltt.html):

> **Metadata:** ID: P1 \| shortcut: mvn-ltt \| author: [JoramSoch](https://github.com/JoramSoch) \| date: 2019-08-27.

Your username will also appear on the [Proof by Number](/Indexes/Proof_by_Number.md) and [Proof by Author](/Indexes/Proof_by_Author.md) index pages.

Additionally, **you can earn money**, as stated in the [project application](https://de.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Fellow-Programm_Freies_Wissen/Einreichungen/The_Book_of_Statistical_Proofs):

> To facilitate and incentivize the unpaid work going into this open science resource, for the first 200 proofs submitted to **The Book of Statistical Proofs**, each submitter will receive 25 â‚¬ per proof.

If you have submitted a proof eligible for the money, please contact [StatProofBook@gmail.com](mailto:StatProofBook@gmail.com) to claim your reward. Money can be received either via SEPA transfer (in Europe) or via PayPal (worldwide).
